# Deployment Guide - SPA Routing Fix

## Problem Solved
- Fixed 404 Not Found errors when refreshing pages
- Fixed logout not working immediately
- Fixed routing issues on all pages except home

## Changes Made

### 1. Router Configuration
- Changed from `createWebHistory()` to `createWebHashHistory()`
- This prevents server-side routing issues

### 2. Server Configuration Files
- `_redirects` - For Netlify
- `vercel.json` - For Vercel
- `netlify.toml` - For Netlify
- `web.config` - For IIS
- `.htaccess` - For Apache
- `404.html` - Fallback page

### 3. Logout Fix
- Added router navigation in Navbar component
- Improved auth store logout function

### 4. Build Configuration
- Updated vite.config.js with proper build settings
- Added security headers

## Deployment Steps

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to your hosting platform

3. Ensure your hosting platform supports SPA routing:
   - Netlify: Uses `_redirects` file
   - Vercel: Uses `vercel.json` file
   - Apache: Uses `.htaccess` file
   - IIS: Uses `web.config` file

## Testing
After deployment, test:
- Refresh all pages (should work)
- Logout functionality (should redirect immediately)
- Direct URL access (should work)
- Browser back/forward buttons (should work)

## Notes
- Hash mode (#) will be used in URLs
- All routes will work without server configuration
- Logout will redirect to login page immediately
